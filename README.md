# What is this project? 

This project is a mockup of a client side banking application using 
JavaScript. It  was created as part of Jonas Schedtmann's, "Complete JavaScript 
Course," available on Udemy, who has provided permission for its use as a 
portfolio piece. All HTML, images, and CSS was provided as a starter
for this application, and all JavaScript was created by the repository owner, 
Kyle Galway. 

# What does this application demonstrate? 

This project is a client side only webpage which demonstrates the use of 
modern JavaScript array transformations, operations, and methods, as well as the
use of timers, intervals, and national currency and time standardizations, all 
using custom callback functions. In order to demonstrate these, it also
showcases base manipulation of the Document Object Model for the insertion and 
deletion of HTML tags and CSS styles. 

# Array Operations 

Some of the array operations performed in this project include: 

<ul>
    <li> Sorting with .sort() </li>
    <li> Mapping with .map() </li>
    <li> Iteration with .forEach() </li>
    <li> Reducing with .reduce() </li>
    <li> Filtering with .filter() </li>
    <li> Finding with .find() </li>
    <li> Splicing with .splice() </li>
    <li> Checking with .some() and .every() </li>
    <li> Splicing with .splice() </li>
    <li> The spread operator </li>
</ul>

In all of the above, the use of method chaining is demonstrated throughout the 
project.

# Timers and Formatting 

Some of the timer and formatting operations performed in this project include: 

<ul>
    <li> Timers with .setTimeout() </li>
    <li> Intervals with .setInterval() </li>
    <li> International Date and time formatting with Intl.DateTimeFormat() </li>
    <li> International currency formatting with Intl.NumberFormat() </li>
</ul>
